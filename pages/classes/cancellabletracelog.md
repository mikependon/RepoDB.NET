# CancellableTraceLog

---

A trace-logging class that is being used to cancel the existing operation. It is used in all BEFORE methods of the [ITrace](/interface/itrace) object. It derives from [TraceLog](/class/tracelog) class.

#### Properties

- `IsCancelled` - is used to determine whether the operation has been cancelled.
- `IsThrowException` - is used to determine whether an exception will be thrown back to the actual operation.
- `Parameter` - handles the parameters of the execution.
- `Statement` - handles the actual SQL statement generated by the library.

#### Methods

- `Cancel` - is used to cancel the actual operation. It accepts the `throwException` argument to define whether an exception will be thrown back to the operation during cancellation.

#### Learnings

Let us say you have a custom trace class named `MyCustomTrace`. Then, you pass this object when you call the [Insert](/operation/insert) operation.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    connection.Insert<Person>(person, trace: new MyCustomTrace());
}
```

You can set a breakpoint at your `MyCustomTrace.BeforeExecution()` method and can call the `Cancel()` method to cancel the operation.

```csharp
public void BeforeExecution(CancellableTraceLog log)
{
    if (log.Statement.IndexOf("INSERT") <= 0)
    {
        log.Cancel(true);
    }
}
```

> By setting the `throwException` argument to `true`, an exception will be thrown back to the actual operation.
