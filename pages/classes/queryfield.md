# QueryField

---

This is used as a field on the query expression. Usually refers to a specific field at the WHERE statement of the SQL statement.

It contains the actual [Field](/class/field), [Operation](/enumeration/operation) and [Parameter](/class/parameter) objects as the properties for equations.

By using this class, it would increase the performance of your application as the library's core implementation is very dependent on the tree structuring of the query objects.

## Creating an Instance

Below is the way on how to create an instance of this class.

```csharp
var field = new QueryField("Id", 10045);
```

Below is the way on how to create an instance of this class with an operation.

```csharp
var field = new QueryField("Id", Operation.Between, new [] { 100, 1000 });
```

Or, with `DbType`.

```csharp
var field = new QueryField("Id", Operation.Between, new [] { 100, 1000 }, DbType.Int);
```

## Use-Cases

This can be very useful if you are running a query in a dynamic way and if you would like to manage the tree structure of your expression.

Imagine working with the API that has a dynamic field structuring (i.e.: OData, AutoQuery, etc).

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var where = new []
    {
        new QueryField("LastName", Operation.Like, "Doe%"),
        new QueryField("State", Operation.Equal, "Michigan"),
        new QueryField("Age", Operation.Between, new [] (20, 40))
    };
    var people = connection.Query<Person>(where);
    // Do the stuffs for 'people' here
}
```

Or in the update operations (for targeted columns).

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var where = new []
    {
        new QueryField("State", Operation.Equal, "Michigan"),
        new QueryField("Age", Operation.Between, new [] (20, 40))
    };
    var person = new
    {
        IsActive = true,
        LastUpdatedUtc = DateTime.UtcNow
    };
    var updatedRows = connection.Update("[dbo].[Person]", person, where);
}
```

Or even in the delete operations.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var where = new []
    {
        new QueryField("State", Operation.Equal, "Michigan"),
        new QueryField("Age", Operation.Between, new [] (20, 40))
    };
    var deletedRows = connection.Delete<Person>(where);
}
```

## Converting to an Enumerable

You can call the `AsEnumerable()` method to convert the instance of this class to an `IEnumerable<QueryField>` object.

```csharp
var fields = new QueryField("CreatedDateUtc", Operation.GreaterThanOrEqual, DateTime.UtcNow.Date.AddDays(-1)).AsEnumerable();
```

## Retrieving the Operation Text

To retrieve the text of the [Operation](/enumeration/operation), simply call the `GetOperationText()` method.

```csharp
var field = new QueryField("CreatedDateUtc", Operation.GreaterThanOrEqual, DateTime.UtcNow.Date.AddDays(-1));
var operation = field.GetOperationText();
```

The value of the `operation` variable would be `>=`.

## DbParameter Property

This property is quitely important if you wish to get a reference to the associated `DbParameter` object on the current instance after the execution.

It is useful if you are retrieving a value of the output parameter from the database after the execution.

## GetValue Method

This method returns the value of the [Parameter](/class/parameter) object currently in used by the instance. However, if the current instance has already been used as a parameter to the execution where the `ParameterDirection` is either of the `Output/Input`, then, the value of the output parameter via `DbParameter` object is returned. This will happen usually if the current instance of this object is of type [DirectionalQueryField](/class/directionalqueryfield).

## Reusability

We sometimes have a scenario to reuse the instance of this class just to avoid creating the same expression.

To reuse the instance, simply call the `Reset()` method.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var where = new []
    {
        new QueryField("LastName", Operation.Like, "Doe%"),
        new QueryField("State", Operation.Equal, "Michigan"),
        new QueryField("Age", Operation.Between, new [] (20, 40))
    };
    var people = connection.Query<Person>(where);
    
    // Do the stuffs for 'people' here

    // Reset here
    where.Reset();

    // Reuse it here
    var customers = connection.Query<Customer>(where);

    // Do the stuffs for 'customers' here
}
```

{: .note }
> Above calls was happened at the `IEnumerable<QueryField>` object. You can also call the `Reset()` method on an instance basis.

## IsForUpdate Method

There is a scenario that we are using this class for the purpose of updates.

Let us say, you have a person named `John Doe` and you would like to update this person's name to `James Doe` using the `Name` field as the qualifier.

See the translated SQL below.

```csharp
> UPDATE [dbo].[Person] SET Name = 'James Doe' WHERE Name = 'John Doe';
```

To make a parameterized statement for this, we need to have a SQL statement like below.

```csharp
> UPDATE [dbo].[Person] SET Name = @Name WHERE Name = @_Name;
```

Where the value of the `@Name` field is `James Doe` and the value of `@_Name` is `John Doe`.

If you create a query field like below.

```csharp
var field = new QueryField("Name", "John Doe");
```

By default, the name of the parameter to be passed for `Name` query field is `@Name`. If you have passed the entity object during the calls to [Update](/operation/update) operation and that instance also contains the `Name` property, then they are colliding. See below.

```csharp
> UPDATE [dbo].[Person] SET Name = @Name WHERE Name = @Name;
```

To fix this issue, you have to call the `IsForUpdate()` explicitly. After the calls, the `Name` property will be prepended by an underscore (`_`) character before the actual execution. The resulted SQL expression would then below, fixing the collision problem.

```csharp
> UPDATE [dbo].[Person] SET Name = @Name WHERE Name = @_Name;
```
