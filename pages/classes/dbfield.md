#### How to Extract?

Below is the way on how to extract the database columns using [IDbHelper](/interface/idbhelper).

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var helper = connection.GetDbHelper();
    var dbFields = helper.GetFields(connection, "[dbo].[Person]");
    // Do the stuffs for the 'dbFields' here
}
```
