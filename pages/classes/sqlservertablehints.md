# SqlServerTableHints

---

This class contains the list of table hints that is useful for SQL Server. It is usually used as passing parameter to the `hints` argument of most operations.

## Usability

To use the hints, simply pass the target hints you want to use.

Below is a sample for querying the dirty records.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var person = connection.QueryAll<Person>(hints: SqlServerTableHints.NoLock);
}
```

Or only reading the commited records.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var person = connection.QueryAll<Person>(hints: SqlServerTableHints.ReadPast);
}
```

Also, below is a sample to lock the table during insertion.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var id = connection.Insert<Person>(person, hints: SqlServerTableHints.TabLock);
}
```

Or during the [Update](/operation/update) operation.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var id = connection.Update<Person>(person, hints: SqlServerTableHints.TabLock);
}
```
