#### Community

- You can place your scenario here. The author will then create an article for that. Simply make a PR [here](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb.NET/blob/master/pages/use-cases.md).

> Further scenarios will be placed over on this page once they are all explored. Everyone can also place their scenario so the author can actually right the recommended approach to solve that scenario.
