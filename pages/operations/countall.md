# CountAll

---

This method is used to count the number of rows from the table.

## Code Snippets

Below is the sample code that count all the rows from the `[dbo].[Person]` table.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var counted = connection.CountAll<Person>();
}
```

## Targeting a Table

You can also target a specific table by passing the literal table and field name like below.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var counted = connection.CountAll("[dbo].[Person]");
}
```

## Table Hints

To pass a hint, simply write the table-hints and pass it in the `hints` argument.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var counted = connection.CountAll<Person>(hints: "WITH (NOLOCK)");
}
```

Or, you can use the [SqlServerTableHints](/class/sqlservertablehints) class.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var counted = connection.CountAll<Person>(hints: SqlServerTableHints.NoLock);
}
```
