# MergeAll

---

This method is used to insert the multiple data entity objects as new rows or update the existing rows from the table. This merge operation only works like UPSERT, it does not do any deletion.

{: .important }
> This operation will insert all the non-existing rows into the table, otherwise, update it based on the given qualifiers.

## Use Case

If you are merging multiple rows in the database, avoid iterating it, instead, insert them by batch. This method solves that problem by creating a multi-packed SQL statements that can be executed in one-go.

The performance of this not comparable to the atomic way of merging the rows. It is more performant and efficient!

You can adjust the size of the batches to further optimize the operation depends on your own situation (i.e.: No. of Columns, Network Latency, Type of Data, etc).

The execution is ACID as the transaction object will be created if not given.

{: .warning }
> Be aware that if you are managing the size of your batch, it may collide on the number of maximum allowable parameters of ADO.NET. The max parameters are 2100.

## Code Snippets

Let us you have a method that returns a list of `Person` models.

```csharp
private IEnumerable<Person> GetPeople()
{
    var people = new List<Person>();
    people.Add(new Person
    {
        Id = 10045,
        Name = "John Doe",
        Address = "New York",
        DateOfBirth = DateTime.Parse("2020-01-01"),
        IsActive = true,
        DateInsertedUtc = DateTime.UtcNow
    });
    people.Add(new Person
    {
        ...
    });
    people.Add(new Person
    {
        ...
    });
    return people;
}
```

Below is the sample code to merge a list of `Person` into the `[dbo].[Person]` table.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var people = GetPeople();
    var mergedRows = connection.MergeAll(people);
}
```

By default, the primary column is used as a qualifier. You can override it by simply passing the list of fields in the `qualifiers` argument.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var people = GetPeople();
    var mergedRows = connection.MergeAll(people,
        qualifiers: (p => new { p.Name, p.DateOfBirth }));
}
```

## Targeting a Table

You can also target a specific table by passing the literal table like below.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var people = GetPeople();
    var mergedRows = connection.MergeAll<Person>("[dbo].[Person]",
        entities: people);
}
```

Or via dynamics (Anonymous Type, `Dictionary<string, object>`, `ExpandoObject`).

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var people = GetPeople();
    var mergedRows = connection.MergeAll("[dbo].[Person]",
        entities: people);
}
```

## Specific Columns

You can also target a specific columns to be merged by passing the list of fields to be included in the `fields` argument.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var people = GetPeople();
    var fields = Field.Parse<Person>(e => new
    {
        e.Id,
        e.Name,
        e.DateInsertedUtc
    });
    var mergedRows = connection.MergeAll<Person>(entities: people,
        fields: fields);
}
```

Or via dynamics.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var people = GetPeople();
    var mergedRows = connection.MergeAll("[dbo].[Person]",
        entities: people,
        fields: Field.From("Id", "Name", "DateInsertedUtc"));
}
```

## Batch Size

You can adjust the size of your batch by simply passing the value at the `batchSize` argument. By default, the value is `10` (found at `Constant.DefaultBatchOperationSize`).

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var people = GetPeople();
    var mergedRows = connection.MergeAll(people,
        batchSize: 30);
}
```

## Table Hints

To pass a hint, simply write the table-hints and pass it in the `hints` argument.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var mergedRows = connection.MergeAll<Person>(person,
        hints: "WITH (TABLOCK)");
}
```

Or, you can use the [SqlServerTableHints](/class/sqlservertablehints) class.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var mergedRows = connection.MergeAll<Person>(person,
        hints: SqlServerTableHints.TabLock);
}
```
