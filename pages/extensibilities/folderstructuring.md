# Folder Structuring

---

This page will guide you on the folder structuring when extending the library with different RDBMS data providers.

### Structures

Let us say you are to support the `Snowflakes`, then below are the recommended structures.

```csharp
+ RepoDb.Snowflakes
    - RepoDb.Snowflakes.sln
    + RepoDb.Snowflakes
        - RepoDb.Snowflakes.csproj
    + RepoDb.Snowflakes.Tests
        + RepoDb.Snowflakes.IntegrationTests
            - RepoDb.Snowflakes.IntegrationTests.csproj
        + RepoDb.Snowflakes.UnitTests
            - RepoDb.Snowflakes.UnitTests.csproj
```

### Namespaces

The namespaces of the classes must be the following.

- All classes that is residing inside the `DbHelpers` folder must have a namespace of `RepoDb.DbHelpers`.
- All classes that is residing inside the `DbSettings` folder must have a namespace of `RepoDb.DbSettings`.
- All classes that is residing inside the `Resolvers` folder must have a namespace of `RepoDb.Resolvers`.
- All classes that is residing inside the `StatementBuilders` folder must have a namespace of `RepoDb.StatementBuilders`.

> They should not be prefixed with RepoDb.Snowflakes.FolderName.
