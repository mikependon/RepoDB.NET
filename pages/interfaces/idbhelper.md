# IDbHelper

---

This interface is used to mark a class to be a database helper object. It is very useful if you would like optimize and override the default implementation of the library (i.e.: retrieving the list of fields, retrieving newly generated identity).

## Methods

Below is the list of methods.

| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| GetFields | Gets the list of [DbField](/class/dbfield) objects from the database. |
| GetScopedIdentity | Gets the newly generated identity from the database. |

## How to Implement?

You have to manually create a class that implements this interface.

```csharp
public class OptimizedSqlServerDbHelper : IDbHelper
{
    public IEnumerable<DbField> GetFields(IDbConnection connection,
        string tableName,
        IDbTransaction transaction = null)
    {
        // Implementations for the GetFields() here
    }

    public object GetScopeIdentity(IDbConnection connection,
        IDbTransaction transaction = null)
    {
        // Implementations for the GetScopeIdentity() here
    }

    ...
}
```

Please see the more detailed implementations at [Database Helper](/extensibility/databasehelper) page.

> You have to implement all the methods needed by this interface. With this, you have the full control of you helper object.

## Usability

Once you have the database helper implemented in a customized class, you can use the [DbHelperMapper](/mapper/dbhelpermapper) class to map it in your target RDDMS data provider.

```csharp
DbHelperMapper.Add(typeof(SqlConnection), new OptimizedSqlServerDbHelper(), true);
```

The library will then use your customized database helper in most of the extended [methods](/docs#methods) of the `DbConnection` object.
