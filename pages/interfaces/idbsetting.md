# IDbSetting

---

This interface is used to mark a class to be a database setting object. It allows you to control the behavior of the library on a specific RDBMS data provider based on the value you provided on the properties this class.

### Properties

Below are the properties available from this interface.

- `AreTableHintsSupported` - gets the value that indicates whether the table hints are supported.
- `ClosingQuote` - gets the character used for closing quote.
- `AverageableType` - gets the default averageable .NET CLR types for the database.
- `DefaultSchema` - gets the default schema of the database.
- `IsDirectionSupported` - gets a value that indicates whether setting the value of `DbParameter.Direction` object is supported.
- `IsExecuteReaderDisposable` - gets a value that indicates whether the `DbCommand` object must be disposed after calling the `DbCommand.ExecuteReader()` method.
- `IsMultiStatementExecutable` - gets a value whether the multiple statement execution is supported.
- `IsPreparable` - gets a value that indicates whether the current DB Provider supports the `DbCommand.Prepare()` calls.
- `IsUseUpsert` - gets a value that indicates whether the [Insert](/operation/insert)/[Update](/operation/update) operation will be used for [Merge](/operation/merge) operation.
- `OpeningQuote` - gets the character used for opening quote.
- `ParameterPrefix` - gets the character used for the database command parameter prefixing.

### How to Implement?

You have to manually create a class that implements this interface.

```csharp
public class MyCustomSqlServerDbSetting : IDbSetting
{
    public bool AreTableHintsSupported { get; set; } = true;
    public string ClosingQuote { get; set; } = "]";
    public Type AverageableType { get; set; } = typeof(double);
    public string DefaultSchema { get; set; } = "dbo";
    public bool IsDirectionSupported { get; set; } = true;
    public bool IsExecuteReaderDisposable { get; set; } = true;
    public bool IsMultiStatementExecutable { get; set; } = true;
    public bool IsPreparable { get; set; } = true;
    public bool IsUseUpsert { get; set; } = false;
    public string OpeningQuote { get; set; } = "[";
    public string ParameterPrefix { get; set; } = "@";
}
```

Please see the more detailed implementations at [Database Setting](/extensibility/databasesetting) page.

### GetHashCode

You have to override the implementation of the `GetHashCode()` based on the combinations of the properties.

The reason to this, the library is using the equality based on the generated hashcode. Failure to comply may trigger a performance problem in your application.

> We recommend to instead use the [BaseDbSetting](/class/basedbsetting) class when implementing a customized database setting.

### Usability

Once the class has been implemented, you have to call the [DbSettingMapper](/mapper/dbsettingmapper) class for mappings (per RDBMS data provider).

```csharp
DbSettingMapper.Add(typeof(SqlConnection), new CustomSqlServerDbSetting(), true);
```
