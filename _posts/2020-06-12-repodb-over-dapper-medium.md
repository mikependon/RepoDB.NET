# Why choose RepoDB ORM over Dapper

---

I had published an article in Medium titled "Why choose RepoDB ORM over Dapper". Though the title seems to be identical on the [article](https://dev.to/mikependon/c-what-will-make-you-choose-repodb-over-dapper-orm-3eb8) that I posted in DEV.to, but the content is completely different.

In this article, you will see and understand the high-level differences of RepoDB from Dapper, it is not a 1-to-1 comparisson like the one I posted at DEV.to. After reading this article, you will most likely understand the concepts and why RepoDB is there and better than Dapper. Enjoy reading the article!

You can see the article from this [link](https://medium.com/dev-genius/why-choose-repodb-orm-over-dapper-da87432c7830?source=friends_link&sk=741afa3a7673827d0eef4ee6942998ce).
