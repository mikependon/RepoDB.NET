Yesterday (April 9, 2020), I had issued a PR to FransBouma's [RawDataAccessBencher](https://github.com/FransBouma/RawDataAccessBencher) with the latest version of [RepoDB](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb), plus with the following updates:

- Upgrading the `System.Data.SqlClient` to version `4.8.0`.
- Referencing the [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/introduction-microsoft-data-sqlclient-namespace?view=sql-server-ver16) version `1.1.1`.
- Added the `Initialize()` method in the [BencherBase](https://github.com/FransBouma/RawDataAccessBencher/blob/master/RawBencher/Benchers/BencherBase.cs) class.

By today (April 10, 2020), FransBouma reach out to me to have some collaborations about the PR (can be found [here](https://github.com/FransBouma/RawDataAccessBencher/pull/50)), in which was approved in few hours after.

Right after the PR's approval, I received a Tweet about the bencher's execution.

**RepoDB remains as the fastest and the most-efficient in .NET ORM library in SET fetches. It is 2 years in a row as of writing this.**

The actual result can be found [here](https://github.com/FransBouma/RawDataAccessBencher/blob/master/Results/20200410_netfx.txt).

### Result for NET Core (Individual Fetches)

RepoDB has downed to 4th place (previous 1st place) in INDIVIDUAL fetches. See the result below.

The actual result can be found [here](https://github.com/FransBouma/RawDataAccessBencher/blob/ac9310c0992dd3a9ed4ffdd01a4bee18bef2fb40/Results/20200410_netcore31.txt#L113).

The reason to this is the update at `v1.10.x`. There is a feature that has been introduced to RepoDB that needs to be executed in every calls to [ExecuteQuery](/operation/executequery) method. This would affect both the INDIVIDUAL and SET fetches. However, the library is fast enough when converting big chunk of records, the effect to SET fetches is not that much.
