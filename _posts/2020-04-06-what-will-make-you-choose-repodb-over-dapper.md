### Introduction

In this page, we will share you the differences and what sets RepoDB apart from Dapper. We tried our best to make a 1-to-1 comparisson for most area. This page will hopefully help you decide as a developer to choose RepoDB as your micro-ORM (with compelling reason).

*&ldquo;I am  an open source contributor and I am here to share you what I had done. I worked hard for it to improve the space of data access in .NET. I personally ask your support towards this library. I hope you share, you blog and use it.&rdquo;*

> All the contents of this tutorial is written by me (the author itself). Our knowledge to Dapper is not that deep enough when compared to our knowledge with RepoDb. So, please allow yourselves to *check* or *comments* right away if you think we made this page bias for RepoDb.

### Before we begin

The programming language and database provider we are using on our samples below are C# and SQL Server. 

Both library is an ORM framework for .NET. They are both lightweight, fast and efficient. The Dapper is a full-fledge micro-ORM whereas RepoDB is a hybrid-ORM.

> To avoid the bias on the comparisson, we will not cover the features that is present in RepoDB but is absent in Dapper (i.e.: `Cache`, `Trace`, `Hints`, `Extensibility`, `StatementBuilder` and `Repositories`) (vice-versa). Also, the comparisson does not included any other extension libraries of both (i.e.: `RepoDb.SqLite`, `RepoDb.MySql`, `RepoDb.PostgreSql`, `Dapper.Contrib`, `DapperExtensions`, `Dapper.SqlBuilder`, etc).

#### Tables

Let us assumed we have the following database tables.

```csharp
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Customer]
(
	[Id] BIGINT IDENTITY(1,1) 
	, [Name] NVARCHAR(128) NOT NULL
	, [Address] NVARCHAR(MAX)
	, CONSTRAINT [PK_Customer] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([Id] ASC )
)
ON [PRIMARY];
GO

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Product]
(
	[Id] BIGINT IDENTITY(1,1) 
	, [Name] NVARCHAR(128) NOT NULL
	, [Price] Decimal(18,2)
	, CONSTRAINT [PK_Product] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([Id] ASC )
)
ON [PRIMARY];
GO

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Order]
(
	[Id] BIGINT IDENTITY(1,1) 
	, [ProductId] BIGINT NOT NULL
	, [CustomerId] BIGINT
	, [OrderDateUtc] DATETIME(5)
	, [Quantity] INT
	, CONSTRAINT [PK_Order] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([Id] ASC )
)
ON [PRIMARY];
GO
```

#### Models

Let us assumed we have the following class models.

```csharp
public class Customer
{
	public long Id { get; set; }
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public string Address { get; set; }
}

public class Product
{
	public long Id { get; set; }
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

public class Order
{
	public long Id { get; set; }
	public long ProductId { get; set; }
	public long CustomerId { get; set; }
	public int Quantity { get; set; }
	public DateTime OrderDateUtc{ get; set; }
}
```

### Basic CRUD Differences

#### Querying multiple rows

#### Dapper

Query:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customers = connection.Query<Customer>("SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Customer];");
}
```

#### RepoDB

Raw-SQL:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customers = connection.ExecuteQuery<Customer>("SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Customer];");
}
```

Fluent:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customers = connection.QueryAll<Customer>();
}
```

#### Querying a single record

#### Dapper

Query:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customer = connection.Query<Customer>("SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Customer] WHERE (Id = @Id);", new { Id = 10045 }).FirstOrDefault();
}
```

#### RepoDB

Raw-SQL:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customer = connection.ExecuteQuery<Customer>("SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Customer] WHERE (Id = @Id);", new { Id = 10045 }).FirstOrDefault();
}
```

Fluent:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customer = connection.Query<Customer>(e => e.Id == 10045).FirstOrDefault();
}
```

#### Inserting a record

#### Dapper

Execute:

By default, it returns the number of affected rows.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customer = new Customer
    {
        Name = "John Doe",
        Address = "New York"
    };
    var affectedRows = connection.Execute("INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customer] (Name, Address) VALUES (@Name, @Address);", customer);
}
```

Query:

Returning the identity value.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customer = new Customer
    {
        Name = "John Doe",
        Address = "New York"
    };
    var id = connection.Query<long>("INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customer] (Name, Address) VALUES (@Name, @Address); SELECT CONVERT(BIGINT, SCOPE_IDENTITY());", customer).Single();
}
```

#### RepoDB

Raw-SQL:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customer = new Customer
    {
        Name = "John Doe",
        Address = "New York"
    };
    var id = connection.ExecuteScalar<long>("INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customer] (Name, Address) VALUES (@Name, @Address); SELECT CONVERT(BIGINT, SCOPE_IDENTITY());", customer);
}
```

Fluent:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customer = new Customer
    {
        Name = "John Doe",
        Address = "New York"
    };
    var id = (long)connection.Insert<Customer>(customer); // or connection.Insert<Customer, long>(customer);
}
```

#### Updating a record

#### Dapper

Execute:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var affectedRows = connection.Execute("UPDATE [dbo].[Customer] SET Name = @Name, Address = @Address WHERE Id = @Id;",
    new
    {
        Id = 10045,
        Name = "John Doe",
        Address = "New York"
    });
}
```

#### RepoDB

Raw-SQL:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var affectedRows = connection.ExecuteScalar<int>("UPDATE [dbo].[Customer] SET Name = @Name, Address = @Address WHERE Id = @Id;",
    new
    {
        Id = 10045,
        Name = "John Doe",
        Address = "New York"
    });
}
```

Fluent:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customer = new Customer
    {
        Id = 10045,
        Name = "John Doe",
        Address = "New York"
    };
    var affectedRows = connection.Update<Customer>(customer);
}
```

#### Deleting a record

#### Dapper

Execute:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var affectedRows = connection.Execute("DELETE FROM [dbo].[Customer] WHERE Id = @Id;", new { Id = 10045 });
}
```

#### RepoDB

Raw-SQL:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var affectedRows = connection.ExecuteScalar<int>("DELETE FROM [dbo].[Customer] WHERE Id = @Id;", new { Id = 10045 });
}
```

Fluent:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var affectedRows = connection.Delete<Customer>(10045);
}
```

### Advance Calls Differences

#### Querying a parent and its children

Let us assumed we have added the `Orders` (of type `IEnumerable<Order>)` property on our `Customer` class.

Customer:

```csharp
public class Customer
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Address { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<Order> Orders { get; set; }
}
```

Order:

```csharp
public class Order
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public long ProductId { get; set; }
    public long CustomerId { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    public DateTime OrderDateUtc{ get; set; }
}
```

#### Dapper

Query:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var sql = "SELECT C.Id, C.Name, C.Address, O.ProductId, O.Quantity, O.OrderDateUtc FROM [dbo].[Customer] C INNER JOIN [dbo].[Order] O ON O.CustomerId = C.Id WHERE C.Id = @Id;";
    var customers = connection.Query<Customer, Order, Customer>(sql,
    (customer, order) =>
    {
        customer.Orders = customer.Orders ?? new List<Order>();
        customer.Orders.Add(order);
        return customer;
    },
    new { Id = 10045 });
}
```

QueryMultiple:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var sql = "SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Customer] WHERE Id = @CustomerId; SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Order] WHERE CustomerId = @CustomerId;";
    using (var result = connection.QueryMultiple(sql, new { CustomerId = 10045 }))
    {
        var customer = result.Read<Customer>().First();
        var orders = result.Read<Order>().ToList();
    }
}
```

#### RepoDB

The `JOIN` feature is not being supported yet. However, there is an alternative way to do this in RepoDb. It can be done via [multi-query](/feature/multiplequery) that executes packed `SELECT`-statements in a single-call.

Raw-SQL:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var sql = "SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Customer] WHERE Id = @CustomerId; SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Order] WHERE CustomerId = @CustomerId;";
    var extractor = connection.ExecuteQueryMultiple(sql, new { CustomerId = 10045 });
    var customer = extractor.Extract<Customer>().FirstOrDefault();
    var orders = extractor.Extract<Order>().AsList();
    customer.Orders = orders;
}
```

Fluent:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customerId = 10045;
    var tuple = connection.QueryMultiple<Customer, Order>(customer => customer.Id == customerId, order => order.CustomerId == customerId);
    var customer = tuple.Item1.FirstOrDefault();
    var orders = tuple.Item2.AsList();
    customer.Orders = orders;
}
```

#### Querying multiple parent and their children

Query:

```csharp
var customers = new List<Customer>();
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var sql = "SELECT C.Id, C.Name, C.Address, O.ProductId, O.Quantity, O.OrderDateUtc FROM [dbo].[Customer] C INNER JOIN [dbo].[Order] O ON O.CustomerId = C.Id;";
    var customers = connection.Query<Customer, Order, Customer>(sql,
    (customer, order) =>
    {
        customer = customers.Where(e => e.Id == customer.Id).FirstOrDefault() ?? customer;
        customer.Orders = customer.Orders ?? new List<Order>();
        customer.Orders.Add(order);
        return customer;
    });
}
```

QueryMultiple:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var sql = "SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Customer]; SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Order];";
    using (var result = connection.QueryMultiple(sql, new { CustomerId = 10045 }))
    {
        var customers = result.Read<Customer>().ToList();
        var orders = result.Read<Order>().ToList();
        customers.ForEach(customer =>
            customer.Orders = orders.Where(o => o.CustomerId == customer.Id).ToList()); // Client memory processing
    }
}
```

#### RepoDB

Raw-SQL:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var extractor = connection.ExecuteQueryMultiple("SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Customer]; SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Order];");
    var customers = extractor.Extract<Customer>().AsList();
    var orders = extractor.Extract<Order>().AsList();
    customers.ForEach(customer =>
        customer.Orders = orders.Where(o => o.CustomerId == customer.Id).AsList()); // Client memory processing
}
```

Fluent:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customerId = 10045;
    var tuple = connection.QueryMultiple<Customer, Order>(customer => customer.Id == customerId, order => order.CustomerId == customerId);
    var customers = tuple.Item1.FirstOrDefault();
    var orders = tuple.Item2.AsList();
    customers.ForEach(customer =>
        customer.Orders = orders.Where(o => o.CustomerId == customer.Id).AsList()); // Client memory processing
}
```

#### Inserting multiple rows

#### Dapper

Query:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customers = GenerateCustomers(1000);
    var identities = connection.Query<long>("INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customer] (Name, Address) VALUES (@Name, @Address); SELECT CONVERT(BIGINT, SCOPE_IDENTITY());", customers);
}
```

**Actually, this is not clear to me:**

- Is it creating an implicit transaction? What if one row fails?
- Is it iterating the list and call the `DbCommand.Execute<Method>` multiple times?

Please correct me here so I can update this page right away.

#### RepoDB

Batch operation:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customers = GenerateCustomers(1000);
    var affectedRows = connection.InsertAll<Customer>(customers);
}
```

The above operation can be batched by passing a value on the `batchSize` argument.

**Note:** You can target a specific column. In addition, the `identity` values are automatically set back to the entities.

Bulk operation:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customers = GenerateCustomers(1000);
    var affectedRows = connection.BulkInsert<Customer>(customers);
}
```

The above operation can be batched by passing a value on the `batchSize` argument.

**Note:** This is just an FYI. The operation is using the [SqlBulkCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlbulkcopy?view=dotnet-plat-ext-7.0) of ADO.Net. This should not be compared to Dapper performance due to the fact that this is a real bulk-operation. This is far (extremely fast) when compared to both Dapper (multi-inserts) and RepoDB (`InsertAll`) operations.

#### Merging multiple rows

#### Dapper

Query:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var sql = @"MERGE [dbo].[Customer] AS T
        USING
            (SELECT @Name, @Address) AS S
        ON
            S.Id = T.Id
        WHEN NOT MATCH THEN
            INSERT INTO
            (
                Name
                , Address
            )
            VALUES
            (
                S.Name
                , S.
            Address)
        WHEN MATCHED THEN
            UPDATE
            SET Name = S.Name
                , Address = S.Address
        OUTPUT INSERTED.Id AS Result;";
    var customers = GenerateCustomers(1000);
    var identities = connection.Query<long>(sql, customers);
}
```

Here, I have the same question as the previous section.

#### RepoDB

Fluent:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customers = GenerateCustomers(1000);
    var affectedRows = connection.MergeAll<Customer>(customers);
}
```

The above operation can be batched by passing a value on the `batchSize` argument.

**Note:** You can set the qualifier fields. In addition, the `identity` values are automatically set back to the entities for the newly inserted records.

#### Updating multiple rows

#### Dapper

Query:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customers = GenerateCustomers(1000);
    var affectedRows = connection.Execute("UPDATE [dbo].[Customer] SET Name = @Name, Address = @Address WHERE Id = @Id;", customers);
}
```

#### RepoDB

Fluent:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customers = GenerateCustomers(1000);
    var affectedRows = connection.UpdateAll<Customer>(customers);
}
```

The above operation can be batched by passing a value on the `batchSize` argument.

**Note:** You can set the qualifier fields.

#### Bulk-inserting multiple rows

#### Dapper

ADO.NET:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customers = GenerateCustomers(1000);
    var table = ConvertToTable(customers);
    using (var sqlBulkCopy = new SqlBulkCopy(connection, options, transaction))
        {
        sqlBulkCopy.DestinationTableName = "Customer";
        sqlBulkCopy.WriteToServer(table);
    }
}
```

**Note:** You can as well pass an instance of [DbDataReader](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.common.dbdatareader?view=net-6.0) (instead of `DataTable`).

#### RepoDB

Fluent:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customers = GenerateCustomers(1000);
    var affectedRows = connection.BulkInsert<Customer>(customers);
}
```

**Note:** You can as well pass an instance of [DbDataReader](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.common.dbdatareader?view=net-6.0).

- Fluent (Targeted):

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customers = GenerateCustomers(1000);
    var affectedRows = connection.BulkInsert("[dbo].[Customer]", customers);
}
```

#### Querying the rows by batch

#### Dapper

Query:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var sql = @"WITH CTE AS
        (
            SELECT TOP (@Rows) ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY Name ASC) AS RowNumber
            FROM [dbo].[Customer]
            WHERE (Address = @Address)
        )
        SELECT Id
            , Name
            , Address
        FROM
            CTE
        WHERE
            RowNumber BETWEEN @From AND (@From + @Rows);";
    using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
    {
        var customers = connection.Query<Customer>(sql, new { From = 0, Rows = 100, Address = "New York" });
    }
}
```

**Note:** You can as well execute it via (LIMIT) keyword. It is on your preference.

#### RepoDB

Fluent:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var customers = connection.BatchQuery<Customer>(e => e.Address == "New York",
        page: 0,
        rowsPerBatch: 100,
        orderBy: OrderField.Parse(new { Name = Order.Ascending }));
}
```

#### Replicate records from different database

#### Dapper

Query:

```csharp
using (var sourceConnection = new SqlConnection(SourceConnectionString))
{
    var customers = sourceConnection.Query<Customer>("SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Customer];");
    using (var destinationConnection = new SqlConnection(DestinationConnectionString))
    {
        var identities = destinationConnection.Query<long>("INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customer] (Name, Address) VALUES (@Name, @Address); SELECT CONVERT(BIGINT, SCOPE_IDENTITY());", customers);
    }
}
```

#### RepoDB

Fluent ([InsertAll](/operation/insertall)):

```csharp
using (var sourceConnection = new SqlConnection(SourceConnectionString))
{
    var customers = sourceConnection.QueryAll<Customer>();
    using (var destinationConnection = new SqlConnection(DestinationConnectionString))
    {
        var affectedRows = destinationConnection.InsertAll<Customer>(customers);
    }
}
```

Fluent ([BulkInsert](/operation/bulkinsert)):

```csharp
using (var sourceConnection = new SqlConnection(SourceConnectionString))
{
    var customers = sourceConnection.QueryAll<Customer>();
    using (var destinationConnection = new SqlConnection(DestinationConnectionString))
    {
        var affectedRows = destinationConnection.BulkInsert<Customer>(customers);
    }
}
```

Fluent (Streaming):

This is the most optimal and recommended calls for large datasets. We do not bring the data as class objects in the client application.

```csharp
using (var sourceConnection = new SqlConnection(SourceConnectionString))
{
    using (var reader = sourceConnection.ExecuteReader("SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Customer];"))
    {
        using (var destinationConnection = new SqlConnection(DestinationConnectionString))
        {
            var affectedRows = destinationConnection.BulkInsert<Customer>(reader);
        }
    }
}
```

**Note:** Check for collation constraints. It is an ADO.NET thing.

### Passing of Parameters

#### Dapper

Dynamic:

```csharp
Query<T>(sql, new { Id = 10045 });
```

It is always an `Equal` operation. You control the query through SQL Statement.

Dynamic Parameters:

```csharp
var parameters = new DynamicParameters();
parameters.Add("Name", "John Doe");
parameters.Add("Address", "New York");
Query<T>(sql, parameters);
```

#### RepoDB

Dynamic:

```csharp
Query<T>(new { Id = 10045 });
```

Same as Dapper, it is always referring to an `Equal` operation. You control the query through SQL Statement.

Linq Expression:

```csharp
Query<T>(e => e.Id == 10045);
```

QueryField:

```csharp
Query<T>(new QueryField("Id", 10045));
```

QueryField(s) or QueryGroup:

```csharp
var queryFields = new[]
{
    new QueryField("Name", "John Doe")
    new QueryField("Address", "New York")
};
Query<T>(queryFields); // or Query<T>(new QueryGroup(queryFields));
```

### Array of Parameters

#### Dapper

Query:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var addresses = new [] { "New York", "Washington" };
    var customers = connection.Query<Customer>("SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Customer] WHERE Address IN (@Addresses);", new { Addresses = addresses });
}
```

#### RepoDB

ExecuteQuery:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var addresses = new [] { "New York", "Washington" };
    var customers = connection.ExecuteQuery<Customer>("SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Customer] WHERE Address IN (@Addresses);", new { Addresses = addresses });
}
```

For further explanation, you can visit our [documentation](https://repodb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/rawsql.html#array-values).

Query:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    var addresses = new [] { "New York", "Washington" };
    var customers = connection.Query<Customer>(e => addresses.Contains(e => e.Address));
}
```

### Expression Trees

- Dapper do not support `Linq Expressions`, only `Dynamics` and `DynamicParameters`.
- RepoDB supports `Linq Expressions`, `Dynamics` and `QueryObjects`.

**Note:** The `DynamicParameters` is just a subset of `QueryObjects`. The `QueryObjects` has much more capability that can further support the `Linq Expressions`.

Please visit both documentation.

- [RepoDB](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb/wiki/Expression-Trees)

### Supported Databases

#### Dapper

Supports all RDBMS data providers.

#### RepoDB

1. Raw-SQLs support all RDBMS data providers.
2. Fluent calls only supports SQL Server, SqLite, MySql and PostgreSql.

### Performance and Efficiency

We only refer to one of the community-approved ORM bencher, the [RawDataAccessBencher](https://github.com/FransBouma/RawDataAccessBencher).

**Net Core:**

Here is our observation from the official execution results. The official result can be found [here](https://github.com/FransBouma/RawDataAccessBencher/blob/master/Results/20190520_netcore.txt).

Performance:

- RepoDB is the fastest ORM when fetching set-records. Both raw-SQL and fluent calls.
- Dapper and RepoDB speed is identical when fetching single-record.
- Dapper is faster than RepoDB's fluent calls when fetching single-record.

Efficiency:

- RepoDB is the most-efficient ORM when fetching set-records. Both raw-SQL and fluent calls.
- Dapper is must more efficient than RepoDB when fetching single-record.

**NetFramework:**

RepoDB is the fastest and the most-efficient ORM for fetching both single and set records. The official results can been found [here](https://github.com/FransBouma/RawDataAccessBencher/blob/master/Results/20190520_netfx.txt).

### Quality

#### Dapper

Dapper is already running since 2012 and is being used by [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com). It has a huge consumers and is hugely backed by the community.

#### RepoDB

We did our best to write one-test per scenario and we have delivered thousand of items (approximately 8K) for both `Unit` and `Integration` tests. We would like your help to review it as well.

Below are the links to our test suites.

> We (or I as an author) has been challenged that the quality of the software does not depends on the number of tests. However, we strongly believe that spending much efforts on writing a test will give confidence to the library consumers (i.e.: .NET community). Practially, it helps us to avoid manual revisits on the already-working features if somebody is doing a PR to us; it prevents the library from any surprising bugs.

#### Conclusion to the Quality

Both is with high-quality but the Dapper is far matured over RepoDb. We will not contest this!

### Library Support

#### Dapper

Proven and is backed hugely by the .NET Community; funded by [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com).

#### RepoDB

Backed by one person and is not funded nor sponsored by any entity. Just starting to expand and asking for more supports from the .NET Community.

### Licensing and Legality

Both is under the [Apache-2.0](http://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) license.

#### Disclaimer

We are not an expert in legal but we are consulting. If any conflict arises on the copyright or trademark in-front of RepoDB, then that is not yet addressed.

### Overall Conclusion

We hope that you somehow consider and revisits this library. It has improve a lot from where it has start.

#### Simplicity

Dapper is lightweight but will drag you to the most complex-level of code development. It is always tedious to write raw-SQLs and it is hard to maintain due to the fact that it is not a compiler friendly. In addition, to obtain necessary task, you need to implement necessary features.

RepoDB is a very easy-to-use ORM with enough feature sets that you can play on.

#### Performance

RepoDB is faster than Dapper, enough reason to choose this library if the only factor is performance.

> RepoDB is the fastest ORM in .NET. This claim is supported by the official run of the community-approved ORM bencher [RawDataAccessBencher](https://github.com/FransBouma/RawDataAccessBencher).

#### Efficiency

RepoDB is more efficient than Dapper (same claim as in Performance).

#### Experience

It is more easier and faster to develop the code snippets with RepoDb. It has a rich feature sets which can be used right-away (i.e.: 2nd-Layer Cache, Fluent Methods). It will help you as a developer deliver more code snippets in fast and clean manner.

#### Features

In RepoDB, by having the necessary features within the space of a micro-ORM will help you a lot on your development.

The features of like `Bulk` & `Batch` operations, `PropertyHandlers`, `2nd-Level Cache`, `Expression Trees`, `Multi Queries` and inline `Hints` are the most common in-used features. The major pain points are, it is absent in Dapper.
