Just today, July 20, 2020, the popular .NET celebrity Scott Hanselman has blogged RepoDb at [hanselman.com](https://www.hanselman.com/).

In his article, he explained how I positioned RepoDb as a .NET ORM, even mentioning my own name. He also highlighted the comparisson of RepoDb and Dapper, plus, the different support to multiple RDBMS data providers.

Scott also showed some of the code he wrote while using RepoDb and also highlighted the BulkInsert operation.

Lastly, Scott highlighted one of the features of RepoDb, the 2nd-Layer Cache, in which I think a thing that give a lot of interests to the readers.

**RepoDb visits, stars and forks surges just right after Scott's blog.**
